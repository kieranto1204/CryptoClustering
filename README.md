This Project had us use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 hour or 7 day price changes.

First we created a dataframe and created a coin_id index that contained the name of the cryptocurrencies.

We then needed to use the elbow method to determine the best values for k, before taking that k value and creating a cluster of the cryptocurrencies for that k value

After repeating those two steps for a Principal Component Analysis and generating those graphs as well, we then put the graphs together and analysed the visual changes that we noticed.
